# Project structure
Router with two templates for demonstrative purposes and one with a form where validation is integrated.

Validation technology has several steps: 
1. There are error messages over required empty fields when button "Submit" is clicked;
2. An error message appears for certain incorrect field when this field is unfocused;
3. When user fills new information in field error message disappear;

To make website responsive special hook "CheckResolution" is integrated, which shows necessary breakpoint as boolean value.

There is a typography with a palette to centralize often-used styles.
